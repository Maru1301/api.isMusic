# isMusic-Backend

This is the back end for isMusic project. This app provides all the data that the front end needs, including, music, member info, and music activities... etc.
In this project, I choose to use C# .Net Core. .Net Core can not only be used on Windows and Mac OS but multiple distributions of Linux. Thus, if some coworkers are using the OS which is not Windows, they can participate in the development still. On the other hand, because I am familiar with C# technology and have some experience building .Net MVC, it could be easier to do the project using .Net-related tech rather than another framework. 

## How to Use

Once you launch the project, you can see the swagger page that contains all the APIs. You can use Postman to test the URL. However, you do not have the database that this project used, and this will make this app unusable. If you would like to try it, please contact me. And I will send you the table scheme of the database. Besides this project uses MS SQL database.
